Subject: [PATCH] xtables-monitor: Fix ip6tables rule printing

When printing an ip6tables rule event, false family ops are used as they
are initially looked up for AF_INET and reused no matter the current
rule's family. In practice, this means that nft_rule_print_save() calls
the wrong rule_to_cs, save_rule and clear_cs callbacks. Therefore, if a
rule specifies a source or destination address, the address is not
printed.

Fix this by performing a family lookup each time rule_cb is called.
